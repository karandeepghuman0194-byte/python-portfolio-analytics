Python-based portfolio analysis of 5 tech stocks vs. NASDAQ-100 using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and yfinance. Computed returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns to assess performance, risk-adjusted returns, and diversification, with visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook.

This project presents a Python-based portfolio analysis model evaluating the performance of five leading technology stocks against the NASDAQ-100 index. Using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and yfinance, the analysis computes returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns to assess both stock-level and portfolio-level performance.

The model builds an equal-weight portfolio, benchmarks it against the NASDAQ-100, and visualizes key insights such as:

📈 Price and return trends

📊 Volatility and drawdowns

⚖️ Risk-adjusted performance

🧩 Diversification benefits

All results are presented through clear, reproducible code and professional visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook, making it ideal for showcasing portfolio analysis
